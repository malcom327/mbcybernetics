Possessing top-tier tooling is undoubtedly advantageous, yet its true value is realized when individuals are empowered to wield it effectively. I derive immense satisfaction from leading and instructing users, ensuring they harness the full potential of these sophisticated tools. My passion lies in not only acquiring cutting-edge technology but also instilling a culture where individuals are adeptly guided to maximize its benefits. This approach underscores my strong managerial and leadership skills, as I emphasize not just the acquisition of tools but the strategic enablement of individuals, fostering a dynamic and empowered workforce.

<span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/trainingslides.jpg %}" alt="" /></span> <p> Throughout my professional journey, I have actively engaged in training and mentoring colleagues to foster expertise in various domains of cybersecurity. Leveraging my comprehensive knowledge of security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR), as well as extensive experience in incident response, threat intelligence and security tooling, I have been instrumental in empowering team members with advanced skills. </p>

<p> Whether conducting sessions on SOAR platforms like Demisto XSOAR or imparting insights into enhancing EDR capabilities with tools such as CrowdStrike and CarbonBlack, my commitment to knowledge transfer has been a cornerstone of my leadership. This includes guiding colleagues in the implementation of automated workflows, the integration of security solutions, and the development of use cases to fortify overall cybersecurity practices. My role as a mentor extends beyond mere technical guidance, encompassing a commitment to cultivating a culture of continuous learning and innovation within the cybersecurity landscape. </p>

Additionally, I have successfully managed third-party resources, optimizing collaboration and project outcomes, and mentored interns, providing them with a valuable foundation for their careers in the dynamic field of cybersecurity.
