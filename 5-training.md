Possessing top-tier tooling is undoubtedly advantageous, yet its true value is realized when individuals are empowered to wield it effectively. I derive immense satisfaction from leading and instructing users, ensuring they harness the full potential of these sophisticated tools. My passion lies not only in acquiring cutting-edge technology but also in fostering a culture where individuals are adeptly guided to maximize its benefits. This approach underscores my strong managerial and leadership skills, as I emphasize not just the acquisition of tools but the strategic enablement of individuals, fostering a dynamic and empowered workforce.

<span class="image left"><img src="../assets/images/trainingslides.jpg" alt=""/></span> Throughout my professional journey, I have actively engaged in training and mentoring colleagues to foster expertise in various domains of cybersecurity. Leveraging my comprehensive knowledge of security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR), as well as extensive experience in incident response, threat intelligence, and security tooling, I have been instrumental in empowering team members with advanced skills.

Whether conducting sessions on SOAR platforms like Demisto XSOAR or imparting insights into enhancing EDR capabilities with tools such as CrowdStrike and CarbonBlack, my commitment to knowledge transfer has been a cornerstone of my leadership. This includes guiding colleagues in the implementation of automated workflows, integrating security solutions, and developing use cases to fortify overall cybersecurity practices. My role as a mentor extends beyond technical guidance, encompassing a commitment to cultivating a culture of continuous learning and innovation within the cybersecurity landscape.

Additionally, I have successfully managed third-party resources, optimizing collaboration and project outcomes, and mentored interns, providing them with a valuable foundation for their careers in the dynamic field of cybersecurity.

Beyond my professional role, I am an active volunteer with ISC², contributing as a Congress and Exam Development Subject Matter Expert (SME). This involvement allows me to shape the future of cybersecurity certifications and ensure that industry standards remain rigorous and relevant. Furthermore, I volunteer at Westminster University as a career and prospective research mentor, guiding aspiring cybersecurity professionals in their academic and career development. These engagements reflect my deep commitment to nurturing the next generation of cybersecurity experts and reinforcing a strong, knowledgeable workforce in the industry.
