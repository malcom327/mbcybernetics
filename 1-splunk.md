<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/complexquery.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>Complex queries on semi-structured used to be a specialty of mine, but more recently I have encouraged the use of observability pipelines to transform unstructured data into structured logs or even metrics. </p>

I am an experienced technical lead and can lead and mentor junior Splunk administrators and developers, as well present roadmaps and budget plans to management.
