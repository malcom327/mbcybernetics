<dl>
  <dt>Incident Response Automation</dt>
  <dd>Streamlined incident response by leveraging SOAR platforms. This involves automating tasks such as data collection, containment actions, and the execution of predefined response playbooks. By doing so, the response to security incidents becomes faster and more coordinated, minimizing the need for manual intervention.</dd>
  <dt>Phishing Response and Remediation</dt>
  <dd>Improved the handling of phishing incidents by automating identification, analysis, and remediation. This involved implementing SOAR workflows to automatically analyze and classify phishing emails, initiate investigations, and execute predefined actions for containment and remediation. This use case minimizes the impact of phishing attacks, ensuring a consistent and timely response throughout the organization.</dd>
  <dt>Search & Destroy</dt>
  <dd>To promptly address phishing threats, the objective was to automate the search and eradication processes. This involved implementing SOAR workflows that automatically scanned for phishing indicators, initiated targeted searches, and executed predefined actions to neutralize and eradicate phishing threats. This use case streamlined the response to phishing incidents, ensuring a proactive and effective approach to identifying and eliminating phishing threats across the organization.</dd>
  <dt>Vulnerability Management and Patching</dt>
  <dd>Automated the identification, prioritization, and resolution of vulnerabilities in the IT infrastructure. This is achieved by integrating vulnerability scanners with SOAR platforms, enabling the automatic processing of scan results. The system then prioritizes vulnerabilities based on criticality and initiates predefined workflows for prompt patching or mitigation. This streamlined use case ensures a proactive and systematic approach to effective vulnerability management. This involved the integration of different technologies and tools including, Splunk, XSOAR, R7, and ServiceNow</dd>
  <dt>Threat Intelligence Integration</dt>
  <dd>Boosted threat detection and response through the automated ingestion and analysis of threat intelligence feeds. This was achieved by integrating SOAR platforms with threat intelligence feeds, enabling automatic correlation of incoming threats with contextual information. Automated workflows were then triggered to adapt security policies, block malicious indicators, and initiate proactive threat-hunting activities. These integrated tools like Proof-Point, Recorded-Futures, Anomali, and others.</dd>
  <dt>Security Tooling</dt>
  <dd>Improved EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) and security tooling coverage by implementing automated processes.
Implementation: Integrated EDR solutions such as CrowdStrike and CarbonBlack, along with ZScaler, to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. Utilized automation through XSOAR, Splunk, SQL, and tray io to achieve comprehensive coverage. Automated workflows facilitated adjustments to security controls, ensuring efficient incident response and threat mitigation.</dd>
